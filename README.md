# os-test

## A Song About Code

```
In the morning light, I boot up my machine,
Lines of code dancing on my screen.
From kernel space to user land so bright,
Operating systems working through the night.

(Chorus)
Oh, OS-test, you're running fine,
Process threads in perfect time.
Scheduling tasks from dawn to dusk,
In your algorithms we trust.

Bits and bytes flow like a stream,
Memory management, a coder's dream.
From fork to exec, the journey goes,
How the system works, now everyone knows.

(Chorus)
Oh, OS-test, you're running fine,
Process threads in perfect time.
Scheduling tasks from dawn to dusk,
In your algorithms we trust.

(Bridge)
Stack and heap in harmony,
File systems store our memory.
Semaphores keep us in sync,
Operating systems, the missing link.

(Final Chorus)
Oh, OS-test, you're our guiding light,
Making computers work just right.
From hardware to software's embrace,
You orchestrate this digital space.
```

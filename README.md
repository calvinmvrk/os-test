## Dubstep Song - "Digital Chaos" (Skrillex-style circa 2010)

### Intro (0:00-0:30)
*Atmospheric synths building tension*
```
Soft pad melodies floating...
Distant vocal chops: "Yes... Oh my god..."
High-pitched synth arpeggios rising
Snare rolls building intensity
```

### Build Up (0:30-0:55)
```
Kick drum pattern intensifying: BOOM-tss-BOOM-tss
Vocal sample: "Call 911 now!"
Synth pitch rising higher and higher
Filter sweeps getting tighter
Bass rumbling underneath
EVERYBODY GET DOWN
Snare rolls faster and faster
```

### DROP 1 (0:55-1:25)
```
WUBWUBWUBWUBWUB
                WUBWUBWUBWUBWUB
WUB-WUB-WUB-WUB
        *SCREECH*
                WAAAAAAAHHHHH
                        
Glitchy robot sounds: BEE-BEE-BEE-BOOM
Bass wobbles morphing: WOMWOMWOMWOM
Laser zaps: PEW PEW PEW
Crushing snares: CRACK-CRACK-CRACK

Transform bass: ERRRRR-ERRRRR-WOMP-WOMP-WOMP
```

### Break (1:25-1:55)
```
*Everything cuts*
Reverb echoing...
Gentle piano melody emerges
Chopped vocals: "Music... takes me... higher..."
Soft synth pads returning
Tension building again...
```

### Build Up 2 (1:55-2:20)
```
Kick drums: BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM
Bass growling louder
Vocal chop: "EVERYBODY JUMP!"
Synths screaming upward
Filter: EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Snare rolls at maximum intensity
```

### DROP 2 (2:20-3:10)
```
BWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
        DUBSTEP!
                
WOMWOMWOMWOM-WUBWUBWUB
                        SCREEEEEEECH
        
Glitch chaos: BRR-BRR-BZZ-BZZ-BOOM
Metallic clangs: CLANG-CLANG-CRASH
Bass modulation: WOOOOOOOOO-ERRRRR-WAAAHHH
Transformer sounds: CHKCHKCHKCHK-BOOM

Laser synths: BWEEEOOOWWW-BWEEEOOOWWW
Robotic screams: AAAHHHH *pitched down* AAAHHHH
Stuttering bass: WUB-WUB-W-W-W-WUB-WUB
```

### Outro (3:10-3:40)
```
Bass wobbles fading out: wub...wub...wub...
Atmospheric pads returning
Vocal whisper: "Oh my god..."
Reverb trails disappearing into silence...
*final bass hit*
BOOM.
```

- Heavy sidechain compression on everything
- Glitch effects and bit crushing
- Vocal chops pitched and chopped aggressively
- Sub bass at 50Hz for maximum destruction
